# R<sup>3</sup>Mat
R<sup>3</sup>Mat allows to generate large graph where the number of edges for each node follows a power law. 

The power law allows to have the majority of vertices with few edges and some with a large number of edges (*hubs*). This can be found in many networks: internet, world-wide-web, railways networks, ...

The code is an implementation of the algorithm described in the paper [R<sup>3</sup>MAT: A Rapid and Robust Graph Generator](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9141251).
